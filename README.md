# 303-Assignment-2
Run assignment 1 like normal and try making data type errors with the index when it ask you to replace a value in the array and adding a value at the end of the array.
Run assignment 2 like normal and pretend to be an employee. I did not do any error checking because it didn't ask for it specifically.
